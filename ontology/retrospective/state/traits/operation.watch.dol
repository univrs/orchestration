exegesis {
  The StateStore trait defines watch_nodes and watch_workloads methods that return
  tokio::sync::mpsc::Receiver for streaming updates. Default implementations return
  NotImplemented error. These are placeholders for future event-driven architecture
  where consumers can subscribe to state changes rather than polling. Would enable
  reactive reconciliation loops and real-time UI updates.
