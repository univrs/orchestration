  state has replication
  state has consensus
  state derives from etcd.protocol

exegesis {
  State can be distributed across multiple nodes for high availability. The etcd
  implementation provides distribution through the Raft consensus protocol, allowing
  multiple etcd nodes to maintain consistent replicas. The in-memory implementation
  is inherently single-node. Distribution enables fault tolerance and geographic
  distribution.
