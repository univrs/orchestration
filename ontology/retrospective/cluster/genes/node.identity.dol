gene node.identity {
  node has id
  node has address
  node has generation
}

exegesis {
  Represents the unique identification of a node in the cluster.

  From the code:
  - ChitchatId contains node_id (UUID string), generation_id (u64), and public_addr (SocketAddr)
  - Node struct has id (NodeId/UUID) and address (String)
  - Generation ID increments on restarts to distinguish node incarnations
  - Identity is immutable once established during cluster join
}
